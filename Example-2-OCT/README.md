# Multiclass classification of OCT images

For this folder, we will be exploring OCT classification using a publicly available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018?resource=download). 

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can be used for imaging of the human body, limited to several hundreds of microns. Therefore, it is suitable for applications in dermatology and ophthalmology. The dataset that we will be using in this example is OCT images of the human retina.
