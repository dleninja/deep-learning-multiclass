# Deep Learning for Multiclass Classification

There are many different tasks that can be performed using deep learning models, i.e., neural networks. One such task is classification or the categorization of data, e.g., images. In the case when there is only two categorization, we would refer to that as *Binary* classification. However, if there are more than one category, it is referred to as *Multi-class* classification. There is another term which is *Mutli-label* classification. This is when a data can be categorized as more than one category.

An example could be a dataset of the outdoors. In each image, there could be a person, a cat, car, etc. The images in that dataset can have multiple labels. Whereas a dataset with images with cat only, people only, and car only images, would be considered a multiclass dataset.

In this repository, I will be showing an example of multiclass classification using a publicly available dataset. For example online datasets, they are available with this [link](https://imerit.net/blog/22-free-image-datasets-for-computer-vision-all-pbm/).
